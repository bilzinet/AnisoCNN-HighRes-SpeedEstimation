# AnisoCNN-HighRes-Estimation
 We propose an Traffic Anisotropic Deep Convolutional Neural Network model exploiting causaility in human-driven vehicular traffic flow to solve inverse problems. We show results for traffic speed field estimation at higher resolution. The key takeaway is that physics-informing deep learning architectures using traffic domain knowledge can significantly reduce model complexity and improve generalizability.
 
 Here are some interesting estimation results:
