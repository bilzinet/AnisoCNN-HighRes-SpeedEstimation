# AnisoCNN-HighRes-Estimation
 We propose an Anisotropic Deep Convolutional Neural Network model exploiting causaility in human-drivne vehicular traffic flow. We show results for traffic speed field estimation. The key takeaway is that physics-informing deep learning models using domain knowledge can significantly reduce model complexity and improve generalizability.
